# 862D+ SMD Rework Station Modifications



This repository contains documentation and resources for upgrading and modifying the 862D+ SMD rework station. The 862D+'s construction stands up to only very light use, but it's affordability makes it the choice of many amateur solderers making their first move from a stand-alone soldering pen to a rework station. However, being prone to failure, their maintenance and repair cost, quickly compensate for the low entry price. 

Despite the 862D+'s practically disposable nature, it does have a clean appearance that makes it a good device for intermediate electronics afficionados to practice troubleshooting, repair, and refurbishing skills. This project aims to improve the hardware and software of this inexpensive, defunct device by replacing its more fragile and underpowered components with more fitting counterparts. The final goal of the project is to deliver a more functional, reliable, user-friendly, and long-lasting device for my electronics bench.

This draft README file serves as the framework for the introduction to that work.
