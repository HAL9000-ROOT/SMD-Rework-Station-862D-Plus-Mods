# 862D+ SMD Rework Station Modifications



This repository contains documentation and resources for upgrading and modifying the 862D+ SMD rework station. The 862D+'s construction stands up to only very light use, but it's affordability makes it the choice of many amateur solderers making their first move from a stand-alone soldering pen to a rework station. However, being prone to failure, their maintenance and repair cost, quickly compensate for the low entry price. 

Despite the 862D+'s practically disposable nature, it does have a clean appearance that makes it a good device for intermediate electronics afficionados to practice troubleshooting, repair, and refurbishing skills. This project aims to improve the hardware and software of this inexpensive, defunct device by replacing its more fragile and underpowered components with more fitting counterparts. The final goal of the project is to deliver a more functional, reliable, user-friendly, and long-lasting device for my electronics bench.

This draft README file serves as the framework for the introduction to that work.

## About the 862D+

The 862D+ SMD hot air gun features both manual or automatic function modes. For repeated usage in a single work session, the manual adjustment can keep the hot air gun hot, and the automatic function, for less frequent use, saves energy by shutting down the device when resting on its magnetic support bracket. The user may adjust both the heating temperature and fan velocity of the gun. 

The soldering iron has manual temperature control.

While the device used for this project includes no branding, the Yihua website (http://yihua-soldering.com/product-1-3-2-hot-air-rework-station-en/147663/) provides specifications for an identical device, as follows:
